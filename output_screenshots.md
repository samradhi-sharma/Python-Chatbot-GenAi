### Features Demonstrated in Screenshots:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The chatbot correctly identified the request for a joke and responded with an appropriate pre-defined joke.

2. **Limitations Awareness**: When asked about the time, the chatbot acknowledged its limitation rather than providing incorrect information.

3. **Self-Identity**: The chatbot can respond to questions about itself in a consistent manner.

4. **Conversational Flow**: The exchange demonstrates a natural back-and-forth conversation pattern similar to human interaction.

These screenshots demonstrate the core functionality of the chatbot and its ability to engage in simple but meaningful conversation through pattern matching.
